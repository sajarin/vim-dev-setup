# vim-dev-setup

The following is a collection of vim development vimrc files that will help a developer utilize vim to its usage, according to me.

The aim of this project is to host a few vimrcs that are sorted by how close it is to vanilla.

.minimalvimrc = a vimrc with no plugins

.vimrc = my personal vimrc with all my plugins, settings, sorted by relevance.
